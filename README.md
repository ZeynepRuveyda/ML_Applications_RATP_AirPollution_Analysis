### Importance of Air Pollution

>Reducing pollutants in the air is important for human health and the environment.
>
>Poor air quality has harmful effects on human health, particularly the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
>
>Pollutants can also damage plants and buildings, and smoke or haze can reduce visibility.
  
### Aim of the project
  
>This project aims at analyzing the air quality in three subway stations.
>
>We will predict to CO2 level for each station from time of day, past values, temperature and humidity
>
>Predict NO/NO2/PM10 levels (+PM25 for Auber) in a selected station from past values,temperature and humidity. Does it help to also consider current CO2 level?
>
>We will compare models for each stations.
>
>Can current levels in two stations help predict levels in third station?
>
>Can surface air quality data help predict NO/NO2/PM10/PM25 levels in subway stations?
